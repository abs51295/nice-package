# nice-package

> Clean up messy package metadata from the npm registry

The [package metadata served by the npm registry](http://registry.npmjs.com/express)
is wonky and messy. npm, Inc maintains a package called
[normalize-registry-metadata](https://github.com/npm/normalize-package-data)
which does a lot of work to clean this data up, but the resulting object is
still kind of inhuman.

`nice-package` uses `normalize-package-data` as a baseline, then does even more
package cleanup:

- uses the `doc['dist-tags'].latest` as the baseline for package metadata
- turns `users` object into a star count
- turns the `time` object into an array of version data
- renames `_npmUser` to `lastPublisher`
- renames `maintainers` to `owners`
- removes internal bookkeeping properties like `_id` and `_from`
- [more...](tests/index.js)

## Installation

```sh
npm install nice-package --save
```

## Usage

`nice-package` exports a class. To create a new package instance,
call `new Package(doc)`, where `doc` is a JSON package object from the npm registry:

```js
const got = require('got')
const Package = require('nice-package')

got('https://registry.npmjs.com/express', {json:true})
  .then(function(doc) {
    var pkg = new Package(doc)
    console.log(JSON.stringify(pkg, null, 2))
  })
```

## Tests

```sh
npm install
npm test
```
